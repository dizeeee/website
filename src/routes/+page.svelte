			<h3>My hobby projects</h3>

			<section>
				<h4>MTG Inventory</h4>
				<p>
					My current hobby project is a system to help me keep inventory of my Magic: The Gathering
					cards. It's similar to services like <a
						href="https://deckbox.org/"
						aria-label="Deckbox.org">Deckbox</a
					>, and I'm building it using
					<a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" aria-label="SvelteKit">SvelteKit</a>,
					<a href="https://neon.tech/" aria-label="Neon Postgres">Postgres</a>,
					<a href="https://turso.tech/" aria-label="Turso SQLite">SQLite</a>, and
					<a href="https://vercel.com/" aria-label="Vercel">Vercel</a>. Currently, I'm working on
					improving database structure so I can make complicated queries that other inventory sites
					struggle with.
				</p>

				<h4>J.B. Hunt Hackathon</h4>
				<p>
					While I was in college, I participated in every hackathon the computer science department
					held. It was an amazing learning experience, and I still attend as a mentor. You usually
					find me running workshops, as well as working with teams on their planning and
					presentation skills.

					students a place find each other and talk. Over time, it has grown into the largest tech
					focused Discord server in Northwest Arkansas.
